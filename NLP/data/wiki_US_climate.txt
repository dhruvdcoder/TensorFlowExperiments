the climate of the united states varies due to differences in latitude and a range of geographic features including mountains and deserts generally the climate of the becomes warmer the further south one travels and drier the further west until one reaches the west coast west of the meridian much of the us has a cold semi arid climate in the interior upper western states to warm to hot desert climates in the far southwestern us while a mediterranean climate prevails along the california coast east of the meridian the climate is humid continental in northern areas locations above north latitude to humid temperate in the central and middle atlantic coast regions to humid subtropical in the gulf and south atlantic regions southern florida is tropical as are hawaii and the us virgin islands higher elevation areas of the rocky mountains the wasatch sierra nevada and cascade range are alpine coastal areas of oregon and washington have an oceanic climate the state of alaska on the northwestern corner of the north american continent is largely dominated by a subarctic climate but with a subpolar oceanic climate in the southeast alaska panhandle southwestern peninsula and aleutian islands and a polar climate in the north the primary drivers of weather in the contiguous united states are the seasonal change in the solar angle the migration north south of the subtropical highs and the seasonal change in the position of the polar jet stream in the northern hemisphere summer the subtropical high pressure systems move northward and closer to the united states mainland in the atlantic ocean the bermuda high creates a south southwest flow of warm humid air over the eastern southern and central united states resulting in warm to hot temperatures high humidity and occasional to frequent thunderstorm activity in the pacific ocean high pressure builds toward the california coast resulting in a northwesterly airflow creating the sunny dry and stable weather conditions prevalent along the west coast in summer in the northern hemisphere winter the subtropical highs retreat southward the polar jet stream and associated conflict zone between cold dry air masses from canada and warm moist air masses from the gulf of mexico drops further southward into the united states bringing major rain ice and snow events and much more variable temperatures with rapid temperature rises and falls not uncommon areas in the southern us florida the gulf coast the desert southwest and southern california however often have more stable weather as the polar jet stream impact does not usually reach that far south weather systems be they high pressure systems anticyclones low pressure systems cyclones or fronts boundaries between air masses of differing temperature humidity and most commonly both are faster moving and more intense in the winter colder months than in the summer warmer months when the belt of lows and storms generally moves into southern canada the gulf of alaska is the origination area of many storms that enter the united states such north pacific lows enter the us through the pacific northwest then move eastward across the northern rocky mountains northern great plains upper midwest great lakes and new england states across the central states from late fall to spring panhandle hook storms move from the central rockies into the oklahoma texas panhandle areas then northeast toward the great lakes they generate unusually large temperature contrasts and often bring copious gulf moisture northward resulting sometimes in cold conditions and possibly heavy snow or ice north and west of the storm track and warm conditions heavy rains and potentially severe thunderstorms south and east of the storm track often simultaneously across the northern states in winter usually from montana eastward alberta clipper storms track east and bring light to moderate snowfalls from the great lakes to new england and often windy and severe arctic outbreaks behind them when winter season canadian cold air masses drop unusually far southward gulf lows can develop in or near the gulf of mexico then track eastward or northeastward across the southern states or nearby gulf or south atlantic waters they sometimes bring rain but can bring snow or ice across the south mostly in interior or northern areas in the cold season generally november to march most precipitation occurs in conjunction with organized low pressure systems and associated fronts in the summer storms are much more localized with short duration thunderstorms common in many areas east of the meridian in the warm season storm systems affecting a large area are less frequent and weather conditions are more solar sun controlled with the greatest chance for thunderstorm and severe weather activity during peak heating hours mostly between pm and pm local time from may to august especially often overnight mesoscale convective system mcs thunderstorm complexes usually associated with frontal activity can deliver significant to flooding rainfall amounts from the dakotas nebraska eastward across iowa minnesota to the great lakes states from late summer into fall mostly august to october tropical cyclones hurricanes tropical storms and tropical depressions sometimes approach or cross the gulf and atlantic states bringing high winds heavy rainfall and storm surges often topped with battering waves to coastal areas regional overview southwest the southwest has a hot desert climate at lower elevations cities like phoenix las vegas yuma and palm springs have average highs over during the summer months and lows in the or even in winter daily temperatures in the southwest are cooler with highs in the and and lows in the in phoenix las vegas and similar southwestern desert areas on average june is the driest month after pacific originating winter storms have concluded and before the southwestern summer monsoon begins the southwest and the great basin are affected by said monsoon from the gulf of california from july september this results in some increase in humidity and cloud cover bringing higher nighttime low temperatures and localized thunderstorms to the region which can result in flash flooding further eastward in the desert southwest tucson az eastward toward el paso tx winter season precipitation decreases while the summer monsoon increasingly provides a summer precipitation maximum for example el paso has a pronounced july to september precipitation maximum still drought has been frequent in the region often lasting for periods of years or longer forest fires across the western united states especially the southwest occur many years and can be severe to extreme in especially hot dry summer seasons northern arizona and new mexico central and northern nevada and most of utah outside higher mountain areas have a temperate semi desert to desert climate but with colder and snowier winters than in phoenix and similar areas and less hot summers as at salt lake city utah summer high temperatures often reach the but low temperatures drop into the low and even as in other temperate desert climates the dry air results in large differences sometimes over degrees between daytime high and nighttime low temperatures precipitation though scarce often falls year round influenced both by summer thunderstorms brought by the southwestern monsoon primarily in southern areas and by winter season storms from the pacific ocean the coast of california has a mediterranean climate daily high temperatures range from to to in the summer to to to in winter with low temperatures from the in summer to the mid in winter like most mediterranean climates much of coastal california has a wet winter and dry summer early summers can often bring cool overcast weather fog and low stratus clouds to coastal california as such the warmest summer weather is delayed until august even september in many areas of the california coast on average september is the warmest month in san francisco ca upwelling of cold pacific waters also contributes to the frequent cool spring and early summer weather in coastal california in california inland river valleys bakersfield sacramento areas the wet winter dry summer pattern remains but winters are cooler and more prone to occasional frost or freeze while summers are much hotter with blazing sunshine and daytime high temperatures not uncommonly in the to over gulf coast lower mississippi valley south atlantic states the gulf and south atlantic states have a humid subtropical climate with mostly mild winters and hot humid summers most of the florida peninsula including tampa and jacksonville along with other coastal cities like houston new orleans savannah ga charleston sc and wilmington nc all have average summer highs from near to the lower and lows generally from to to combined with moist tropical air this creates the sultry summer weather conditions that prevail here in the interior south in cities like raleigh nc atlanta birmingham al nashville tn and jackson average summer highs and lows are similar to coastal areas while some areas of interior eastern and central texas dallas austin and san antonio areas have average daily highs in the mid to upper in winter average daily high temperatures range from the upper south northern arkansas kentucky and virginia to the along the gulf coast and south atlantic coast charleston southward with in central and southern florida and far southern texas average daily lows in winter range from north to along the gulf and far south atlantic coasts with in florida and coastal south texas much of the interior south tennessee kentucky and the northern gulf states has a winter or spring maximum in precipitation with december march or april typically the wettest month and august to october the driest months for example at birmingham al huntsville al tupelo ms and memphis tn from november to april these areas commonly experience sharp conflicts between cold dry air from canada and warm moist air from the gulf of mexico fueled by abundant gulf moisture these air mass clashes often produce heavy precipitation in winter and spring across the mid south here thunderstorms can occur any month with severe weather possible especially in november and from late february to may much of the mid south lies within dixie alley an area of relatively high tornado risk given the prevailing heat and humidity summer season thunderstorms can occur throughout the south but they are heavier and more frequent along the gulf coast south atlantic coast norfolk va area southward and in peninsular florida along most of the gulf coast new orleans and pensacola areas and in south atlantic coastal and sand hills areas columbia sc fayetteville nc raleigh nc wilmington nc and norfolk va july and august are usually the wettest months and precipitation is fairly evenly distributed the rest of the year primarily from august to early october the coastal gulf and south atlantic states are susceptible to being struck by tropical weather systems tropical depressions tropical storms and hurricanes which can bring damaging to destructive winds very heavy rains and damaging oceanic storm surges in winter snow sleet and ice can occur mostly in the south middle and northern regions when southerly tracking storms throw gulf or atlantic moisture over cold canadian air at ground level southern florida has a tropical climate with all months having a mean temperature of higher than a wet season from may through october and a dry season from november through april in cities like fort lauderdale miami key west naples and palm beach average daily highs range from the mid in winter to near in summer average overnight lows range from the upper in winter to the mid and upper in summer southern florida is the warmest region of the us mainland in winter southern plains lower midwest middle east coast the region from the southern plains to the lower midwest eastward to the central east coast the new york city coastal connecticut region southward to virginia has a temperate climate with cool to cold winters and warm to hot humid summers daytime highs range from to to in summer to to to in winter lows range from the in summer to to to in winter cities in this region include wichita ks st louis mo springfield il indianapolis in columbus oh pittsburgh pa philadelphia pa washington richmond va new york city ny new haven ct and atlantic city nj precipitation is spread fairly evenly throughout the year though as one travels from indiana westward there is an increasingly prominent early summer concentration with a may maximum in northern texas and oklahoma and a june maximum increasingly evident from central northern indiana westward to kansas as one travels from east to west across texas oklahoma and kansas average annual precipitation steadily decreases far western texas el paso area is desert and average annual precipitation is less than twenty inches mm in westernmost kansas and the oklahoma panhandle where the climate qualifies as semi arid in the lower midwest and southern plains states especially temperatures can rise or drop rapidly winds can be extreme and clashing air masses including hot dry air of mexican and or southwestern origin warm moist air from the gulf of mexico and cold dry air from canada can spawn severe thunderstorms and tornadoes particularly from april to june the dryline separating hot dry air of mexican southwestern origin from warm moist air from the gulf of mexico often causes severe occasionally violent thunderstorms to fire in central and eastern texas oklahoma and kansas these sometimes contribute toward the hailstorms and tornado outbreaks that the southern plains are well known for reflecting these air mass conflicts central oklahoma including the oklahoma city and moore norman areas has the highest frequency of tornadoes per unit land area on planet earth with may the highest risk month for tornadoes throughout tornado alley from northern texas north northeastward toward western and central iowa northern great plains north central great lakes new england the northern half of the great plains nebraska northward northern midwest great lakes and new england states have a humid continental climate here there are four distinct seasons with warm to hot summers and cold and often snowy winters average daily high temperatures range from in north dakota and central and northern minnesota to in winter to to to in summer while overnight lows range from below in winter in north dakota and much of minnesota to to to in summer in the new england states precipitation is evenly distributed around the year with a slight late fall early winter november december maximum along the new england coast from boston ma northward due to intense early winter storms in the great lakes states cold arctic air in winter crossing the relatively warmer lake waters can result in frequent and sometimes very heavy lake effect snow especially on the eastern and southern shores of the great lakes for example in western michigan lower peninsula and in the buffalo ny area cities in this area include minneapolis mn omaha ne sioux falls sd fargo nd chicago il cleveland oh buffalo ny albany ny boston ma concord nh and augusta me as one travels from east to west across nebraska south dakota and north dakota average annual precipitation steadily decreases and the westernmost counties of these states have a semi arid climate with about or just over inches of precipitation per year on average see climate data for williston nd rapid city sd and scottsbluff ne in the upper midwest and northern plains states temperatures may rise or fall rapidly and winds from warm season thunderstorms or larger scale low pressure systems can be strong to extreme here air mass conflicts primarily involve warm moist air from the gulf of mexico clashing with cool to cold dry air from canada with only occasional intrusions of hot dry air from the southwest the conflicts between canadian and gulf air commonly produce severe thunderstorms including hailstorms especially on the western plains and tornadoes particularly in may and june in the northern plains and north central states generally june is the year wettest month on average owing to maximum shower and thunderstorm activity also june is the highest risk month for severe weather throughout north dakota south dakota minnesota iowa wisconsin and northern illinois pacific northwest the pacific northwest has an oceanic climate the climate is wet and cool in autumn winter and spring and stable and drier in the summer months especially july and august on average the wettest month is typically november or december the driest july in the summer months average highs in cities like seattle and portland are from to to with lows from to to while in winter daily highs are from to to and overnight lows from to to in winter the pacific northwest especially coastal districts and other areas west on the prevailing windward side of the olympic and cascade mountain ranges experiences a mostly overcast wet and cool climate but without severe cold like that found in the interior northern minnesota north dakota at lower elevations winter precipitation falls mostly as rain however snow does occur even at the lowest elevations primarily when pacific moisture interacts with cold air intruding into the pacific northwest from western canada alberta and interior british columbia in seattle wa and portland or winter season snowfall varies greatly in seattle the average winter season snowfall is about inches in january the coldest month in pacific northwest history seattle received an all time record inches of snow that same month portland received inches summers in the pacific northwest are generally cool especially along the coastline the great basin and columbia plateau the intermontane plateaus are arid or semiarid regions with high summer temperatures in the to occasionally over at lower elevations at boise id with annual precipitation averaging less than inches mm as a result of the rain shadow of the sierra nevada and cascades both coastal and interior areas of oregon and washington and southern idaho have a wet winter dry summer precipitation pattern but traveling eastward into montana and wyoming this transitions progressively toward relatively drier winters and a may and eventually june precipitation maximum the latter characteristic of the northern plains and much of the upper midwest both dakotas nebraska iowa and minnesota precipitation the characteristics of precipitation across the united states differ significantly across the united states and its possessions late summer and fall extratropical cyclones bring a majority of the precipitation which falls across western southern and southeast alaska annually during the fall winter and spring pacific storm systems bring most of hawaii and the western united states much of their precipitation most of florida has a subtropical monsoon rainfall pattern wet summer and dry winter in the central and upper eastern united states precipitation is evenly distributed throughout the year although summer rainfall increases as one moves southeastward lake effect snows add to precipitation potential downwind of the great lakes as well as great salt lake and the finger lakes during the cold season the average snow to liquid ratio across the contiguous united states is meaning inches mm of snow melts down to inch mm of water the el southern oscillation affects the precipitation distribution by altering rainfall patterns across the west midwest the southeast and throughout the tropics during the summer the southwest monsoon combined with gulf of california and gulf of mexico moisture moving around the subtropical ridge in the atlantic ocean bring the promise of afternoon and evening thunderstorms to the southern tier of the country as well as the great plains equatorward of the subtropical ridge tropical cyclones enhance precipitation mostly from august to october across southern and eastern sections of the country as well as puerto rico the united states virgin islands the northern mariana islands guam and american samoa over the top of the ridge the jet stream brings a summer precipitation maximum to the great lakes large thunderstorm areas known as mesoscale convective complexes move through the plains midwest and great lakes during the warm season contributing up to of the annual precipitation to the region extremes in northern alaska tundra and arctic conditions predominate and the temperature has fallen as low as on the other end of the spectrum death valley california once reached officially the highest temperature ever recorded on earth on average the mountains of the western states receive the highest levels of snowfall on earth the greatest annual snowfall level is at mount rainier in washington at inches cm the record there was inches cm in the winter of this record was broken by the mt baker ski area in northwestern washington which reported inches cm of snowfall for the snowfall season other places with significant snowfall outside the cascade range are the wasatch mountains near the great salt lake and the sierra nevada near lake tahoe along the coastal mountain ranges in the pacific northwest rainfall is greater than anywhere else in the continental us with quinault ranger station in washington having an average of inches mm hawaii receives even more with inches mm measured annually on average on mount waialeale in kauai the sonoran desert in the southwest is home to the driest locale in the us yuma arizona has an average of inches mm of precipitation each year overall average natural disasters and effects because of contrasting air masses the great plains the midwest and the southern united states have frequent severe thunderstorms and tornado outbreaks during both the spring and the summer in central portions of the tornadoes are more common than anywhere else in the world they usually can touch down during the spring and the summer the strip of land from north texas north to nebraska and east into southern michigan is known as tornado alley where many houses have tornado shelters and where many towns have tornado sirens stretching across mississippi and alabama dixie alley has experienced both tornadoes and violent thunderstorms with peak tornado season coming on as early as february and waning by may florida also reports many tornadoes but these rarely are very strong the southern us has a second tornado season during the autumn generally the area at greatest risk for tornadoes migrates northward from february to june peaking in the gulf states in february and march the ohio valley and lower midwest in april southern and central plains and central midwest in may and northern plains and upper midwest dakotas minnesota and wisconsin in june both the appalachian region and the midwest experience the worst floods widespread severe flooding is rare some exceptions include the great mississippi flood of the great flood of and widespread flooding and mudslides caused by the el event in the western united states localized flooding can however occur anywhere mudslides from heavy rain can even cause problems in any mountainous areas particularly in the southwest the narrow canyons of many mountain areas in the west and severe thunderstorm activity during the monsoon season in summer leads to sometimes devastating flash floods as well on the other hand nor easter snowstorms can bring activity to a halt in both the new england and great lakes regions in the us sustains billion annually in damage from floods the southwest has the worst droughts one is thought to have lasted over years and to have decimated the anasazi people large stretches of desert shrub in the west can fuel the spreads of wildfires although severe drought is rare it has occasionally caused some major problems such as those during the dust bowl which coincided with the great depression farmland failed throughout the plains entire regions were virtually depopulated and dust storms ravaged the land more recently the western us experienced widespread drought from to in terms of deaths from heatwaves losses occurred between and a mean of per year disproportionate number of men a full of deaths versus women have
