australia climate is governed largely by its size and by the hot sinking air of the subtropical high pressure belt this moves north and south with the seasons but it is variable with frequent droughts lasting several seasons thought to be caused in part by the el southern oscillation the climate varies widely due to its large geographical size but by far the largest part of australia is desert or semi arid only the south east and south west corners have a temperate climate and moderately fertile soil the northern part of the country has a tropical climate varied between tropical rainforests grasslands and desert because australia is a small continent separated from polar regions by the southern ocean it is not subject to the movements of frigid polar air that sweep over the continents in the northern hemisphere during winter consequently its winter is relatively mild so that there aren any great contrast between summer and winter temperatures that is present in the northern continents yet in many parts of the country seasonal highs and lows can be considerable temperatures have ranged from above to well below nonetheless minimum temperatures are moderated the el southern oscillation is associated with seasonal abnormality in many areas in the world australia is one of the continents most affected and experiences extensive droughts alongside considerable wet periods occasionally a dust storm will blanket a region and there are reports of the occasional tornado tropical cyclones heat waves bushfires and frosts in the country are also associated with the southern oscillation rising levels of salinity and desertification in some areas is ravaging the landscape climate change in australia is a highly contentious issue temperatures in the country have risen following an increasing trend of global warming between the years of to by approximately overnight minimum temperatures have warmed more rapidly than daytime maximum temperatures in recent years the late century warming has been largely attributed to the increased greenhouse effect according to the bureau of meteorology of the land has less than mm in of rainfall per year and has even less than mm in as a whole australia has a very low annual average rainfall of mm in states and territories australian capital territory because of its elevation ft and distance from the coast the australian capital territory experiences a continental climate unlike many other australian cities whose climates are moderated by the sea canberra has relatively mild and wet summers although hot days occur from time to time canberra has cold winters with occasional fog and frequent frosts many of the higher mountains in the territory south west are snow covered for at least part of the winter thunderstorms can occur between october and march and annual rainfall is mm in with rainfall highest in spring and summer and lowest in winter the highest maximum temperature recorded in the act was at acton on january the lowest minimum temperature was at gudgenby on july new south wales over half of new south wales has an arid or semi arid climate however the eastern portion has a temperate climate ranging from humid subtropical to the central coast and most of sydney and oceanic to the south coast the snowy mountains region in the south east falls in the alpine climate or subpolar oceanic climate zone with cool to cold weather all year around and snowfalls in the winter further inland the climate gets semi arid and a desert climate towards the western part of the state the weather in the southern half of the state is generally warm to hot in summer and cool in the winter the seasons are more defined in the southern half of the state especially as one moves inland towards south west slopes central west and the riverina region rainfall usually peaks in the summer in most of parts of the state though the riverina region which is in the southern central part of the state bordering victoria has drier summers and a winter rainfall peak the warmest region is the north west part of the state where summers are very hot and winters cooler and drier the weather in the northeast region of the state or the north coast bordering queensland is hot and humid in the summer with a rainfall peak and mild in winter with more sunshine and little seasonal temperature difference the northern tablelands which are also on the north coast have relatively mild summers and cold winters due to their high elevation on the great dividing range the coldest region is the snowy mountains where the snow and frost continues for quite a long period during the winter months the blue mountains southern tablelands and central tablelands which are situated on the great dividing range have mild to warm summers and cold winters although not as severe as those in the snowy mountains furthermore some areas situated in or around the range such as bathurst and goulburn among other places have recorded freezing and or near freezing lows virtually in every month of the year a feat that rarely occurs in many other places of similar latitude and altitude in the northern hemisphere the highest maximum temperature recorded was at menindee in the state west on january the lowest minimum temperature was at charlotte pass on june in the snowy mountains this is also the lowest temperature recorded in the whole of australia excluding australian antarctic territory rainfall varies throughout the state the far north west receives the least less than mm in annually while the east receives between to mm to in of rain northern territory the northern territory has two distinctive climate zones the northern end including darwin has a tropical savannah climate aw with high humidity and two seasons the wet november to april and dry season may to october during the dry season nearly every day is warm and sunny and afternoon humidity averages around there is very little rainfall between may and september in the coolest months of june and july the daily minimum temperature may dip as low as but very rarely lower and frost has never been recorded the wet season is associated with tropical cyclones and monsoon rains the majority of rainfall occurs between december and march the southern hemisphere summer when thunderstorms are common and afternoon relative humidity averages over during the wettest months on average more than mm in of rain falls in the north thunderstorms can produce spectacular lightning displays the central region is the desert centre of the country which includes alice springs and uluru and is arid or semi arid with little rain usually falling during the hottest months from october to march its seasons are more defined than the northern parts with summers being very hot where temperatures often exceed on average and winters relatively cool with average minimum temperatures dipping as low as with a few frosty nights central australia receives less than mm in of rain per year the highest maximum temperature recorded in the territory was at finke on and january the lowest minimum temperature was at alice springs on july queensland because of its size there is significant variation in climate across the state low rainfall and hot summers are typical for the inland west a monsoonal wet season in the far north and warm subtropical conditions along the coastal strip inland and in southern ranges cooler temperatures are experienced especially at nights the climate of the coastal strip is influenced by warm ocean waters keeping the region free from extremes of temperature and providing moisture for rainfall there are five predominant climatic zones in queensland based on temperature and humidity hot humid summer far north and coastal warm humid summer coastal elevated hinterlands and coastal south east hot dry summer mild winter central west hot dry summer cold winter southern west temperate warm summer cold winter inland south east granite belt however most of the queensland populace experience two weather seasons a winter period of rather warm temperatures and minimal rainfall and a sultry summer period of hot sticky temperatures and higher levels of rainfall the highest maximum temperature observed in the state is at birdsville on december the temperature of at cloncurry on january is not considered official the figure quoted from birdsville is the next highest so that record is considered as being official the lowest minimum temperature is at stanthorpe on june and at the hermitage on july south australia the majority of the state has the arid and semi arid climates the southern coastal parts of the state have a mediterranean climate with mild wet winters and hot dry summers the highest rainfall occurs along the southern coasts and the mount lofty ranges with an average annual rainfall of millimetres in in the vicinity of mount lofty the lowest rainfall occurs in the lake eyre basin where the average annual totals are less than millimetres in and possibly even millimetres in most of the rain in the southern districts of the state fall during the winter months when the sub tropical high pressure belt is displaced to the north over the australian continent south australia mean temperature range is in january and in july daily temperatures in parts of the state in january and february can be up to the highest maximum temperature was recorded as at oodnadatta on january which is the highest official temperature recorded in australia the lowest minimum temperature was at yongala on july tasmania tasmania has a cool temperate climate with four seasons summer lasts from december to february when the average maximum sea temperature is and inland areas around launceston reach other inland areas are much cooler with liawenee located on the central plateau one of the coldest places in australia with temperatures in february ranging between to to autumn lasts between march and may and experiences changeable weather where summer weather patterns gradually take on the shape of winter patterns the highest recorded maximum temperature in tasmania was at scamander on january during the south eastern australia heat wave tasmania lowest recorded minimum temperature was on june at butlers gorge shannon and tarraleah victoria victoria has a varied climate despite its small size it ranges from semi arid and hot in the north west to temperate and cool along the coast victoria main land feature the great dividing range produces a cooler mountain climate in the centre of the state victoria southernmost position on the australian mainland means it is cooler and wetter than other mainland states and territories the coastal plain south of the great dividing range has victoria mildest climate air from the southern ocean helps reduce the heat of summer and the cold of winter melbourne and other large cities are located in this temperate region the mallee and upper wimmera are victoria warmest regions with hot winds blowing from nearby deserts average temperatures top during summer and in winter victoria highest maximum temperature of was recorded in hopetoun on february during the south eastern australia heat wave screen temperature of was recorded on january in mildura the victorian alps in the north east are the coldest part of victoria the alps are part of the great dividing range mountain system extending east west through the centre of victoria average temperatures are less than in winter and below in the highest parts of the ranges the state lowest minimum temperature of was recorded at omeo on june and again at falls creek on july victoria is the wettest australian state after tasmania rainfall in victoria increases from north to south with higher averages in areas of high altitude median annual rainfall exceeds mm in in some parts of the north east but is less than mm in in the mallee rain is heaviest in the otway ranges and gippsland in southern victoria and in the mountainous north east snow generally falls only in the mountains and hills in the centre of the state rain falls most frequently in winter but summer precipitation is heavier rainfall is most reliable in gippsland and the western district making them both leading farming areas victoria highest recorded daily rainfall was millimetres in at tanybryn in the otway ranges on march western australia most of western australia has a hot arid and semi arid climate however the south west corner of the state has a mediterranean climate the area was originally heavily forested including large stands of the karri one of the tallest trees in the world this agricultural region of western australia is in the top nine terrestrial habitats for terrestrial biodiversity with a higher proportion of endemic species than most other equivalent regions due to the offshore leeuwin current the area numbers in the top six regions for marine biodiversity containing the most southerly coral reefs in the world average annual rainfall varies from mm in at the edge of the wheatbelt region to mm in in the wettest areas near northcliffe the southwestern most tip of australia but in the months of november to march although rain still falls evaporation exceeds rainfall and it is generally very dry plants must be adapted to this as well as the extreme poverty of all soils major reduction in rainfall has been observed with a greater number of rainfall events in the summer months the central four fifths of the state is semi arid or desert and is lightly inhabited with the only significant activity being mining annual rainfall averages about to mm to in most of which occurs in sporadic torrential falls related to cyclone events in summer months an exception to this is the northern tropical regions the kimberley has an extremely hot monsoonal climate with average annual rainfall ranging from to mm to in but there is a very long dry season of months from april to november eighty five per cent of the state runoff occurs in the kimberley but because it occurs in violent floods and because of the insurmountable poverty of the generally shallow soils the only development has taken place along the ord river australia tropical subtropical location and cold waters off the western coast make most of western australia a hot desert with aridity a marked feature of a greater part of the continent these cold waters produce precious little moisture needed on the mainland study by australian and american researchers investigated the desertification of the interior and suggested that one explanation was related to human settlers who arrived about years ago snowfall in the state is rare and typically only in the stirling range near albany the southwestern most point in wa as it is the only mountain range far enough south and with sufficient elevation more rarely snow can fall on the nearby porongurup range snow outside these areas is a major event it usually occurs in hilly areas of south western australia the most widespread low level snow occurred on june when snow was reported in the perth hills as far north as wongan hills and as far east as salmon gums however even in the stirling range snowfalls rarely exceed cm in and rarely settle for more than one day the highest observed maximum temperature of was recorded at mardie station on february the lowest minimum temperature recorded was at eyre bird observatory on august precipitation rain more than of the island has an annual rainfall of less than mm in only antarctica receives less rainfall than australia place inland near lake eyre in south australia would only receive mm in of rain annually another place troudaninna bore altitude in south australia from to received in average mm inches of precipitation from one extreme to another parts of the far north queensland coast annually average over mm in with the australian annual record being mm in set at the summit of mount bellenden ker in there are four main factors that contribute to the dryness of the australian landmass cold ocean currents off the west coast low elevation of landforms dominance of high pressure systems shape of the landmassthe average annual rainfall in the australian desert is low ranging from to mm to in per year thunderstorms are relatively common in the region with an average of to thunderstorms per annum summer daytime temperatures range from to to in winter this falls to to to the southern parts of australia get the usual westerly winds and rain bearing cold fronts that come when the high pressure systems move towards northern australia during winter cold snaps may bring frosts inland though temperatures near the coast are mild or near mild all year round summers in southern australia are generally dry and hot with coastal sea breezes during a lengthy dry spell hot and dry winds from the interior can cause bushfires in some southern and eastern states though most commonly victoria and new south wales the tropical areas of northern australia have a wet summer because of the monsoon during the wet typically october to april humid north westerly winds bring showers and thunderstorms occasionally tropical cyclones can bring heavy rainfall to tropical coastal regions which is also likely to reach further inland after the monsoonal season the dry season comes winter which brings mostly clear skies and milder conditions rainfall records tend to be concentrated along the east coast of australia particularly in tropical north queensland the highest hour rainfall on record in australia was millimetres in in crohamhurst on february the highest monthly rainfall on record was millimetres in recorded at mount bellenden ker queensland in january the highest annual rainfall was millimetres in recorded also at mount bellenden ker in additionally the location which receives the highest average annual rainfall in australia is babinda in queensland with an annual average of millimetres in low rate of evaporation from this very cool body of water result in little evaporation occurring hence rain clouds are sparsely formed and very rarely do they form long enough for a continuous period of rain to be recorded australia arid semi arid zone extends to this region the absence of any significant mountain range or area of substantial height above sea level results in very little rainfall caused by orographic uplift in the east the great dividing range limits rain moving into inland australia australia has a compact shape and no significant bodies of water penetrate very far inland this is important in as much as moist winds are prevented from penetrating inland so keeping rainfall low snow in australia snow falls frequently on the highlands near the east coast in the states of victoria new south wales and tasmania and in the australian capital territory there is a regular snow season in several areas which have seasonal ski tourism industries such as thredbo cabramurra mount buller and perisher ski resort among others snow also falls with some regularity on the great dividing range as far north as stanthorpe queensland and in isolated parts of south australia and western australia but outside these areas snow is an extremely rare occurrence snow has also fallen on uluru and near alice springs on at least one occasion snow at sea level is occasionally recorded on mainland australia but is more frequent in tasmania where snowfalls at sea level can occur during the winter months snow has been recorded across most of tasmania though it is rare on the northern coast at sea level snow is rare in the southernmost capitals like melbourne and hobart falling less than once every five years and in the other capitals it is unknown however snow has fallen in the hill suburbs of perth and adelaide however there are extensive well developed ski fields in the great dividing range a few hours drive from melbourne and sydney light snow generally falls every winter in canberra however and other cities that may receive regular seasonal snowfalls include orange oberon lithgow and katoomba in new south wales the occasional cold snap caused by cold air drifting north from antarctica can cause significant snowfall in rural areas as well as major cities such as hobart melbourne outer mountain suburbs and canberra such occasions are rare but have occurred in and the event causing snow to fall as far north as eungella near mackay in tropical queensland extreme snow events have also produced snow as far north west as longreach in queensland and in the ranges near alice springs and also in lowland towns such as dubbo and wagga wagga in new south wales the frequency and intensity of such events have been decreasing significantly over the past years and the most northerly occurrence of snow in this time frame has been the bunya mountains in southern queensland temperatures the tropical savannah zone of northern australia is warm to hot all year round summers are hot in most of the country with average january maximum temperatures exceeding over most areas of the mainland except for those at high elevations though winters are warm in the north and cool in the south with nightly frosts common in inland areas south of the tropic of capricorn only at the highly elevated areas do wintertime temperatures approach those found in much of europe or north america especially the southern parts temperatures in australia have followed an increasing trend between the years of to by approximately overnight minimum temperatures have warmed more rapidly than daytime maximum temperatures the observed warming has hastened in recent years the late century warming has been largely attributed to the increased greenhouse effect temperature differences between winter and summer are minor in the tropical region of australia however they are greatest in the southern inland with seasonal differences along the coast being moderated by the ocean proximity in july a more common latitudinal distribution of average maximums is apparent ranging from near the north coast to below in the mountainous areas of the south east average minimum temperatures in all seasons are highest in northern australia and near the coastal areas and are lowest in the elevated areas of the south east the highest average january minimum temperatures near are found near the north west coast while in winter they exceed at some coastal locations in northern australia and on the torres strait and tiwi islands in the mountains of new south wales it is not unusual to have average low minimum temperatures dipping below in january and in july comparatively most inland non mountainous areas south of the tropics have average july minimum between and in the desert the dry air and clear skies give rather large ranges in temperature between day and night ranges of being typical and not quite unusual light nighttime frosts in winter occur over much of the southern half of the arid zone where mean july minimum temperatures are mostly in the to range moving north frosts become increasingly rare with mean july minimum being around on the northern boundary the highest maximums in australia are recorded in two regions the pilbara and gascoyne regions of north western western australia and the area extending from south western queensland across south australia into south eastern western australia many locations in this region have recorded temperatures exceeding in january average maximum temperatures exceed over a large area of the interior and exceed over areas in the north west the highest summer maximums in the pilbara and gascoyne average at around in some years daily maximums consecutively exceed for several weeks at a time extremes the most powerful heatwave in the history of south eastern australia occurred in january adelaide on the melbourne on the and sydney on the all had record high temperatures during this period as did many other central district areas in new south wales victoria and south australia the record number of consecutive days in melbourne over is five with brisbane and sydney each having two heatwaves usually bring by oppressively warm nights with oodnadatta sa recording an australian record of nine nights above in february another extreme event was a prolonged period of extensive heatwaves known as the angry summer in early marble bar achieved consecutive days above in nyang had an average maximum of for the months of february and january an australian record at the other extreme average january maximums are near on the highest peaks of the south east ranges and near in much of tasmania in most of the desert region during summer cool days are rare and usually associated with major rain events a rather exceptional example occurred in february when many areas failed to reach on one or more days and the maximum at boulia western queensland was at which was below normal many other locations in australia except those above metres have extreme maximums between and most tasmanian sites away from the north coast have had extreme maximums between and the lowest extreme maximums are found along the north coast of tasmania at low head and at high elevations at thredbo while extreme high temperatures are more common inland than they are near the coast notable extreme maximum have been observed near the coast at mardie at roebourne western australia at whyalla and at ceduna south australia at lower elevations most inland places south of the tropics have extreme minimum between and and these low temperatures have also occurred in locations within a few kilometres of southern and eastern coasts such as sale victoria bega new south wales grove tasmania and taree new south wales many locations in this region have recorded or lower including gudgenby in the australian capital territory and woolbrook new south wales in the desert the lowest extreme minimum occur at high elevations especially around alice springs where the temperature has fallen as low as in the tropics extreme minimum near or below have occurred at many places distant from the coast as far north as herberton queensland some locations near tropical coasts such as mackay townsville and kalumburu western australia have also recorded temperatures near in contrast some coastal locations such as darwin have never fallen below and thursday island in the torres strait has an extreme minimum of the lowest maximum temperature on record in australia was recorded on july at thredbo ski resort in new south wales the highest minimum temperature on record was recorded on january in arkaroola south australia and again on january in wittenoom western australia list of extremes can be found in the tables below natural hazards and disasters bushfires climatic factors contribute to australia high incidence of bushfires particularly during the summer months low relative humidity wind and lack of rain can cause a small fire either man made or caused naturally by lightning strikes to spread rapidly over large distances low humidity the heat of the sun and lack of water cause vegetation to dry out becoming a perfect fuel for the fire high winds fan the flames increasing their intensity and the speed and distance at which they can travel many of the worst bushfires in eastern australia such as the ash wednesday fires accompany el southern oscillation events which tend to cause a warm dry and windy climate the worst bushfires in australian history occurred on black saturday in february the human death toll of the disaster was and over two thousand homes were lost flooding though australia is generally dry and arid a large portion of the country is in the tropics rainfall in these areas is extremely heavy with some are areas recording world record breaking rain such as the mountains which lie to the south west of cairns through la years the eastern seaboard of australia records above average rainfall usually creating damaging floods the la system has broken many rainfall records in australia particularly in the states of queensland and new south wales which have seen extensive flooding which has caused major damage to infrastructure and crops the central east area of queensland an area the size of germany and france combined was under water in the estimated damage bill could reach into the billions some places that see heavy monthly or yearly rainfall include darwin cairns townsville rockhampton innisfail strahan queenstown thursday island and mount read global warming according to climate scientists climate change is predicted by the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation csiro to have significant effects on the climate of and extreme weather events in australia increasing temperatures and the likelihood of heat waves according to the bureau of meteorology australia annual mean temperature for was above the average making it the nation second warmest year since high quality records began in summer in both and continued this trend of record breaking heat was australia third hottest year on record and broke national records in january the bureau of meteorology altered its weather forecasting chart temperature scale to include a range coloured purple between and coastal communities face risks from sea level rise albeit over a long period of time based on current estimates of the ipcc fourth assessment report the gold coast being built on sand and with many canal developments could be considered particularly at risk suburbs of sydney like drummoyne and concord on rivers like the parramatta river face risks of inundation of low lying areas such as parks such as timbrell park and majors bay reserve reclaimed from mudflats at the heads of bays or massive expenses in rebuilding seawalls to higher levels currently there are several environmental movements and campaigners advocating for action on climate change one such campaign is the big switch australia largest community climate change campaign new projections for australia changing climate includes droughts are likely to become more frequent particularly in the south west evaporation rates are likely to increase particularly in the north and east high fire danger weather is likely to increase in the south east sea levels will continue to rise drought drought in australia is defined by rainfall over a three month period being in the lowest ten per cent of amounts having been recorded for that region in the past this definition takes into account that low rainfall is a relative term and rainfall deficiencies need to be compared to typical rainfall patterns including seasonal variations specifically drought in australia is defined in relation to a rainfall deficiency of pastoral leases and is determined by decile analysis applied to a certain area historical climatic records are now sufficiently reliable to profile climate variability taking into account expectations for regions state governments are responsible for declaring a region drought affected and the declaration will take into account factors other than rainfall cyclones australia is affected by tropical cyclones which primarily occur between december and april but have developed in november and may as well cyclones over mainland australia occur on average five to six times each year the region between broome and exmouth are most prone to cyclones tropical cyclones are known to bring destructive winds heavy rain with flooding creating storm surges along the coast causing inundation in low lying areas the strongest australian region cyclone was cyclone monica in which had wind gusts in excess of km mph cyclones can also move inland decaying to a rain depression which dump heavy rain in these areas and causing flooding the worst cyclones of australia have caused billions of dollars of damage and many deaths cyclone tracy crossed directly over darwin in seventy one people were killed adjusted for inflation it was australia most damaging cyclone cyclone mahina in brought a storm surge to far north queensland reaching metres ft high causing deaths and making it the worst natural disaster to befall australia cyclone larry struck north queensland and passed over innisfail in causing damages estimated at billion but no lives were lost cyclone yasi caused severe flooding and had a total estimated cost of billion making it the second most costliest cyclone to strike australia blizzards blizzards are not common in mainland australia but occur frequently in the snowy mountains in new south wales and victoria when blizzards do occur they can affect the tasmanian highlands and particularly mount wellington which towers over the tasmanian capital hobart blizzards do not affect any major towns or cities because there are no populated areas located in the mountains except for the ski resort towns of new south wales and victoria dust storms dust storm or sandstorm a meteorological phenomenon common in arid and semi arid regions arises when a gust front passes or when the wind force exceeds the threshold value where loose sand and dust are removed from the dry surface particles are transported by saltation and suspension causing soil erosion from one place and deposition in another the term sandstorm is used most often in the context of desert sandstorms especially in the sahara when in addition to fine particles obscuring visibility a considerable amount of larger sand particles moves closer to the surface the term dust storm is more likely to be used when finer particles are blown long distances especially when the dust storm
